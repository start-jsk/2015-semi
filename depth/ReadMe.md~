This is turtlebot program avoids objects and reaches goal destination.

How to use :
1.
roscore

2.
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

3.
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

4.
go to /src/
python nao_depth_odom.py

The other programs are trivial. you can erase all python files exept transformations.pyc (Copyright (c) 2006, Christoph Gohlke)
.


The problem remaining : finding nao is not done yet.
			This is good for avoiding objects, but not good for reach goal destination. Much better algorithm is required.
